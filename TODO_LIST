1. Allow for recording of transactional length within workloads
2. Add constraints on creation of further batches (prioritize txns that are "free to execute" at arrival)
3. Sort the return value of gen_uniform before returning (or change the description.... it's actually not strictly necessary I think)
4. Add execution threads constraint (not only \infty)
5. BatchSchedule::build_schedule does not need to return a unique pointer... change that
6. Enable different weighting functions in batch creation
7. Enable multi-threaded simulations (each simulation is still single-threaded but the experiments are separated across cores)
8. Write dependency file for python scripts
9. Change the makefile so that simulation is no longer treated as a test ...
10. Decouple data dump for bursty and uniform workloads for completion time etc.
11. Refactor the graph creating scripts... Right now its 3 ways for 3 different graphs
12. Add graphs for loc contention experiments
13.
