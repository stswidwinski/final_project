1. Create a simulation framework with tests
  a. Create a function to actually make a schedule from a stream of txns. 
    NOTE: for now we assume no knowledge of the locks being held when building the next batch. 
  b. Decide on the tests
  c. Compare between:
    1) Real-time graph building (v. short batches)
    2) Global graph building (single batch)
    3) Medium (1 or 2 sizes) batch sizes

    NOTE: 
        The metric we look at is the latency of the system and the total time necessary to complete.
    
    Assumptions:
        - Txns come in uniformtly at random times. The time necessary to complete a txn is also uniform and random from a range and does not depend on the # of locks requested.
        - # of locks requested is random 
        - Contention will be controlled for
2. Tests within the simulation framework
3. Addition of different sorting methods for txns within the simulation framework. Inclusion of those for tests.
4.
